Step 4: Assign Static IP Address

Edit the network configuration file by running the following command.

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

This file may look like the following.

Edit the configuration as follows.

auto ens18
iface ens18 inet static
  address 192.168.0.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 89.207.128.252 89.207.130.252

Make sure not to change the loopback adapter config. After the change, it will look something like the following screenshot.

Save the file and exit from the editor.
Step 5: Restart Networking Service

Restart the networking service so that the updated configuration can be applied. Run the command.

sudo systemctl restart networking
