As a Debian user, you can easily set up a static IP by using your terminal. To do so, firstly, you have to select an active network interface on your system.
How to check available network interfaces on Debian 11

You can utilize the “ip” command to get the details about your system’s currently available network interfaces. The “ip” is an abbreviation for “Internet Protocol”. The “ip” command is a utility used by network and system administrators in Linux-based systems to configure network interfaces. In the “ip” command, “link” is the sub-command added to view and modify the network interface. Write out the below-given command in your Debian 11 terminal for viewing the currently available network interfaces:
$ ip link

From the output, we will note down the name of our active network interface, which is “enpos3”. As “enpos3” is the network interface for which we will set up a static IP:

Now, open the configuration file of the network interfaces “/etc/network/interfaces” in the nano editor:
$ sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

With the default settings, your network interfaces configuration file will look like this:

In the “/etc/network/interfaces” file, add the following details about your network interface, such as its static IP address, which you want to set up, netmask, gateway, dns-nameservers:
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
address 192.168.2.2
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.2.2
dns-nameservers 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8

Here, the first two lines declare that we are setting a static IP address for the “enpos3” network interface:

To save the changes you have made in the network interface configuration file, press “CTRL+O”:

How to restart the networking service on Debian 11

After configuring the static IP address for the “enpos3” network interface, now we will restart the networking service using the systemctl command:
$ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service

You can verify if your Debian system has configured the static IP for your selected network interface:
$ ip a

From the output, you can see that we have successfully configured static IP address our “enpos3” network interface to “192.168.2.2”:
